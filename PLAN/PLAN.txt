Explanation of the project
Hotel international

Plan 1
We will implement a software application using Java for a hotel reservation system.
This reservation system will entail all the information needed for a user to login, 
book one or more rooms and cancel the reservation.
(USER:manager,guest)
There could be two types of rooms (economic and luxury), 
which will be shown with pictures that the user can see and choose from.
Manager can log in and see the list of all the clients that reserved a room. he can see the price and pay
